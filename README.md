C++HTML
=======

C++HTML is a C++ GUI Library that is using HTML. That is, you can write your GUI in HTML and CSS, but application logic in C++. API is very easy if you already know JavaScript (most methods are named the same as in javaScript, for example "node.appendChild(next)" or "node.style.color").
It's rendering engine is using OpenGL, so it's cross platform.

Motivation of this project was that I'm doing MockUps in Html, since I can create a rich UI in a couple of minutes. Most C++ Gui Libraries requiere you to learn new stuff and why not use something that you already know?! Also, there is no easy way to access the DOM in cef (only through javascript callbacks, ugh)


C++HTML is in a very early stage of development. Many Html Elements and CSS Style Attributes aren't supported yet.



A list of supported elements and style attributes will soon be uploaded.
